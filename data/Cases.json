		"paragraph1": "Rob's website had a very old look-and-feel to it, think late 90’s. To create a new, fresh design they contacted Soulia Moor from Moor Design. I chipped in with some feedback on the design and did the programming. Besides that they also couldn’t access their files, so they wanted to be hosted on a different platform. In this process I guided them and contacted the previous developer of the old website.",
		"paragraph2": "Let me guide you through my process! At first, to speed up the time it took to develop and deploy Soulia and me decided it was best to create a One Pager without a CMS for now. Since I did want to have this option for a later date, I decided to go with a robust setup of Vue, Vuetify and Nuxt.",
		"paragraph3": "I did a market research and compared multiple hosting providers to find out which one was the best option for Rob and Lya. I always highly prefer ones with good customer service so that in the case something breaks, you have helpful people to talk to.",
		"paragraph4": "In the end Cloud86 came out ahead of the other companies on customer service, price, uptime and speed. The website is currently in my aftercare, as such I update regularly and redo parts of the site when requested. Check out the result through the link below."

		"paragraph1": "With this campaign page and their policies surrounding it VanMoof really wants to demonstrate that they are done with bike theft. While their whole webshop was made with Magento, they wanted to step out of that and have a React based webpage for this campaign within 3 days! Beforehand I was asked if I could make this happen, since the design was already done, I jumped at the opportunity and said \"YES let's do this!\"",
		"paragraph2": "Since we had to move fast due to the high pressure of the tight deadline, we chose the technologies fast as well. All of a sudden I had to learn how to work with Material UI, Spring, JSS and TSX in about a day. In hindsight I think we may have gone a bit overboard with all these technologies, but it was a great challenge nonetheless.",
		"paragraph3": "It was very interesting to see the level of communication between VanMoof, the CTO of Reach Digital and me. Everything went very fast and smooth, well thought out decisions were made on the fly and highly efficient discussions sprang up.",
		"paragraph4": "All in all I definitely learned a lot from this on a technical level, but also on a personal level: That I should stand my ground and make a case for not using too many new technologies at once, especially when it is only for one page."
